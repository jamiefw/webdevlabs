    <p>Hi! I'm Jamie Jane Figueroa Weston, a passionate student at Carnegie Mellon University,
        where I am pursuing a degree in Information Systems.
         My interests lie at the intersection of technology, design, and social impact,
          and I am especially driven by how technical solutions can enhance accessibility
          , sustainability, and everyday life. I enjoy exploring innovative ways to apply
           my skills in software development and design to create positive change. 
           When I'm not studying or coding, I love watching movies, listening to music,
            reading non-fiction books, and cooking Spanish food. I am committed to using
             my technical expertise to make a meaningful impact in the world.</p>
